    <h1>Request Guards</h1>
    <p>
        Incoming requests often require a few checks in order to evaluate their integrity. These checks include
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Is the payload/the query malformed?</li>
        <li>Does the payload correlate to the right types?</li>
        <li>Does the payload need to be sanitized?</li>
    </ul>

        <p>
            A request guard captures the request and is in its easiest form similar to a model declaration.
            By defining properties we decide which properties are optional or required, which properties should be cast into a type,
            and what default values should be considered. Without further configuration, a request guard ends a request with an error message before executing your controller.
